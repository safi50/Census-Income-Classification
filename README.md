This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on the Census Income dataset. The models used in this project include Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifier.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year using classification techniques. Two models are trained and compared: Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifier. This project serves as an example of handling imbalanced datasets and using ensemble methods for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Census Income Data (also known as "Adult" dataset), which can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). The dataset includes features such as:

- age
- workclass
- education
- marital-status
- occupation
- relationship
- race
- sex

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
